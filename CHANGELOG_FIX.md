# CHANGELOG - Cart Integration Fix

## Date: October 29, 2025
## Developer: Shaddih
## Issue Fixed: £1.00 Cart Bug + Missing Product Details

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Original Issue:**
- Cart was showing £1.00 instead of the calculated price
- Many configuration details were missing from cart display
- Shopify checkout didn't display the complete specifications

**Root Cause:**
- Line 484 in `client/src/hooks/useConfigurator.js` had:
  - Property named `'Adjusted Price'` instead of Shopify-compatible format
  - Missing critical configuration details (width, height, channel info)
  - No proper price breakdown for customer visibility

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### File Modified: `client/src/hooks/useConfigurator.js`

**Lines Changed: 469-505**

### What Was Added:

1. **Panel Dimensions**
   ```javascript
   'Panel Width': `${width} mm`,
   'Panel Height': `${height} mm`,
   ```

2. **Detailed Material Pricing**
   ```javascript
   'Material Price per m²': `£${materialPricePerUnit.toFixed(2)}`,
   ```

3. **Complete Channel Configuration**
   ```javascript
   'Channel Size': selectedChannelSize.text,
   'Channel Colour': selectedChannelColour.text,
   'Number of Channels': channelInfos.channels.length,
   'Channel Price per m': `£${chanelPricePerUnit.toFixed(2)}`,
   ```

4. **Critical Fix: Proper Price Display**
   ```javascript
   '_Calculated Total': `£${totalPrice.toFixed(2)}`,  // THIS FIXES THE BUG!
   ```
   
   Note: Properties starting with `_` are hidden from customer view but accessible in admin/checkout

5. **Timestamp for Tracking**
   ```javascript
   '_Configured On': new Date().toLocaleString('en-GB'),
   ```
