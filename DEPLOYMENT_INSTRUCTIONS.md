```bash
cd client
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies including the new `jspdf` package.

### Step 2: Build the Client

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in `client/dist/`

### Step 3: Test Locally First

**Start the server:**
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
npm start
```

**In another terminal, start the client:**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and test:
1. Configure a sign panel
2. Click "Add to Cart"
3. Verify correct price shows (not Â£1.00)
4. Try the PDF quote generator
5. Check the success modal animation

### Step 4: Deploy to Shopify

Once tested and working:

1. Build the client: `npm run build`
2. Deploy using Shopify CLI or your existing deployment process
3. Test on staging environment
4. Deploy to production
